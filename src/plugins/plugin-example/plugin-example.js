 * to import this class in the hooks.js, instantiate it and run the plugin methods
 * on hooks defined on hooks.js
 * @see /src/config/hook-example.js
 *
 * It is possible to use values from the store, like, for example:
 * store.getters.mapCenter, store.getters.mapBounds and store.getters.mode
 * It is also possible to emit events using the eventBus. For example:
 * appLoader.getInstance().eventBus.$emit('mapViewDataChanged', mapViewDataChanged)
