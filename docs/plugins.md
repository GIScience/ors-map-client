# Plugins #

The ORS maps app has support for plug-ins that can add new features or change existing features. An custom created plug-ins engine is responsible for checking the existence of plug-ins in the `src/plugins` and running hooks that will call specific methods of each plug-in.

## Files involved ##

The services, classes and components that are involved with the support for plugins are:

- `@/support/app-hooks` - class responsible for running actions related to the plugin engine cycle, like `add` and `run`.
- `@/common/global-mixins` - set a pointer to a instance of `AppHooks` to the main vue instance.
- `@/config/hooks` - register the plugin hooks
- `@/main` - loads the registered hooks and runs the `appLoaded` hook.

## Plugin structure ##

Each plug-in must be contained in a folder created under the `src/plugins` folder.
For example: src/plugin/my-awesome-plugin. No file should be directly put in the root of the `plugins` folder.

Each plug-in must have be a class with methods that can be called on hooks defined in the hooks.js.
Check the ExamplePlugin in `plugin-example/plugin-example.js`.

## Creating and registering a plugin ##

There are events, or hooks, that are called during the app execution and when certain actions take place. These hooks are run by executing AppHooks `run`, passing the event/hook name as first parameter and the event parameters as the second argument. On its turn, the run method will check if there are active plug-ins that are listening for that hook/event. If that is the case, the every plug-in listening for that hook will be called. The way to add a listener for an hook in a plug-in is by adding a method with the name of a hook. The `@/plugins/plugin-example` folder contains an example of plugin. Check an excerpt of it below:

```js
class PluginExample {
  // Declare a class constructor to receive the main vueInstance
  constructor (vueInstance) {
    this.vueInstance = vueInstance
  }

  // mapReady is the name of a hook and is declared as a method.
  mapReady (hookData) {
    console.log('PluginExample: mapReady callback', hookData)
  }
```

In order to active the PluginExample an entry to the `config/hooks.js` must be added, like the following:

```js
// Import the plugin module
import PluginExample from '@/plugins/plugin-example/plugin-example.js'

// Import AppLoader to have access to appHooks.add
import AppLoader from '@/app-loader'

// Get appHooks instance reference
const appHooks = AppLoader.getInstance().appHooks

// Add a listener to the `appLoaded` hook, and register the plugin when it is called
appHooks.add('appLoaded', (vueInstance) => {
  const pluginExample = new PluginExample(vueInstance)
  appHooks.attachPlugin(pluginExample, vueInstance)
})
```

## What can be used in a plug-in ? ##

In addition to the parameters passed to each method via hook call, inside a plug-in you can use the values stored in the
[vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/) store. In order to access the app store you need to import store from '@/store/store') and access it via,
for example `store.getters.mapBounds`.

You can also use the app constants to compare values. For this import `constants` from `@/resources/constants`.

Within the plug-in you can also set listeners to events emitted via `evenBus`, for example `mapViewDataChanged`,
as well as emit those events.
Some events emitted via `eventBus` are:

- `mapViewDataChanged`
- `loadAvoidPolygons`
- `showLoading`
- `removePlace`
- `markerDragged`
- `filtersChangedExternally`
- `directionsFromPoint`
- `directionsToPoint`
- `addRouteStop`
- `appRouteDataChanged`

You can search the entire app for `eventBus.$on(` to find all the events emitted via eventBus.

## List of all hooks available ##

Check below the list of all hooks available, how they are expected to be declared (as methods), the arguments passed and what is expected to returned in each declared method (in the case something is expected to be returned).

  }

  /**
   * Method to get the current mapViewData and potentially
   * change it. As it is an object, when you change it you are
   * changing the original object.
   * The MapView is watching to changes to this object and
   * will re-render the displayed content on the map view
   * when it is changed.
   * IMPORTANT: this method is expected to be called on
   * hooks.js on the mapViewDataChanged hook.
   * @param {MapViewData}
